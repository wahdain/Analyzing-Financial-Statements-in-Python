# Analyzing Financial Statements in Python
### A toolkit to read financial statements, compute ratios, handle missing data, and visualize results using Python &amp; Seaborn

#### The balacne sheet:
A snapshot at a point in time of a company's assets, liabilities, and share holder's equity

### $$Assets=Liabilities + Shareholders' equity$$

#### Assets
* Curren assets: benefits usually reaped within one year (Accounts recievable, Inventory)
* Non-current assets: benefits reaped over the long run (Long term investment, Property, Plant and equipment)

#### Liabilities
* Current liabilities: usually to be repaid within one year (Accounts payable, Short term loans)
* Non-current liabilities: can be paid off after one year (Long term loans)

#### Shareholder equity


#### Financial ratios from the balance sheet

### $$Current Ratio=Current Assets/Current Liabilities$$
* Measure of company's ability to meet short-term burdens
* Note: ratio greater than one considered good

### $$Debt To Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Shareholders' Eqity$$
* Measure of outside money versus owners' money being used to run company operations
* Note: Companies using relatively more debt are called leveraged companies

### $$Equity Multiplier Ratio = Total Assets/Total shareholders' Equity$$
* Measure of how much assets are funded by the woners of the business
* Note: Low ratio means company uses relatively vore debt to fun its assets

### $$Debt To Assets Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets$$
* Measure of whether the business has enough total assets to pay off its debts
* Note: If the ratio is more than 1, this means shareholders' equity in negative

### Family of ratios

#### Liquidity ratio
Measure company's ability to meet short-term financial obliqations, e.g.
* Current ratio

#### Leverage ratio
Show how company uses equity and debt to finance its activities, e.g.
* Depet to equity ratio
* Equity multiplier ratio

#### Solvecy ratio
Measures company's financial health
* Dept to assets ratio

### Income Statement

#### The income statement shows company's revenue and expenses over a period of time

### $$Net Income = Total Revenue - Total Expenses$$
* Operating expenses: cosst of goods sold, markiting expenses, and depreciation
* Non-operating expenses: Interest expenses, and income taxes

### $$Gross Margin Ratio = Total Revenue Cost of Goods Sold / Total Revenue$$

### $$Operating Margin Ratio = (Total Revenue - Operating Expenses)/Total Revenue$$

both ratios are belong to efficiency family ratio

#### Efficiency ratio measures company's ability to gererate income via its resources



### Ratios from the balance sheet and income statement

### $$Asset Turnover Ratio=Total Revenue/Total Assets$$
Measures how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate revenue


### Cash flow statment

#### Cash flow statement Show me the money!

#### Accrual method of accounting
* Transaction record in income statement when it takes plase, not when cash is exchange
#### Cash flow statement
* Tells us busniss' cash and cash equivalents in a financial period
* Records transactions when cash is exchanged
* Entries in cash flow statement are linked to entries of the income statement and balance sheet

#### Types of cash flow statement
* Indirect method: Based on the accrual method of accounting - accountant starts with net income(or loss)and adjusts up or down depending on transactions done in cash
* Direct method: Recording cash transaction when they take place 

#### Structure of cash flow statement
The cash flow statement is usually broken down into three parts:
* Cash from operating activities
  o Focuses on cash flows in the core business
  o Accunt receivable
    - Customers to pay at a later date
    - Increase in accounts receivable is a cash outflow
* Cash from investing activities
  - Focuses on cash generated( or lost)from investing activities of the company
  - Investment that pay cash will be a cash infow
  - Purchase of property, plant, and equipment(with cash)is a cash outflow
* Cash from financing activities
  - Focused on cash generated (or lost) from financing activities of the company
  - Dividends paid in cash to the investors of the company is a cash outflow

#### Cash flow to net income ratio
### $Proportion Of Cash Flow From Operation = Cash Flow From Operation Activities / Net Income$
- Operating activities are core activities of the business
- High ratio implies business generates sizable proportion of cash from operating activities

#### Operating cash flow ratio
### $Proportion Of Cash Flow From Operating = Cash Flow From Operating Activites / Current Liabilities$
- Measure of how many times company can pay off short-term obligations from cash generated from core business
- Ratio of more than one implies that a business generates more than enough cash to meet its short-term obligation
